# TableTopSat

Final project for GEOG 651.

TableTopSat will allow users to interact with satellite data in a simulation to further understanding of how remote sensing data is captured.

C++ assets will include:
- a satellite actor that computes the state vectors given a set of Keplerian orbital elements
- WIP: A LandSat Actor that will read the data from satellite actor and move along orbit path
- WIP: A Spline Actor that will take in orbit points and create a spline to visualize the orbit 

3D assets will include:
- LandSat 7
- Terra Satellite
- Fancy room
